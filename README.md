# Advanced Systems Lab
The project consists of the design and development of a middleware platform for key-value stores
as well as the evaluation and analysis of its performance, and development of an analytical model
of the system, and an analysis of how the model predictions compare to the actual system
behavior. The middleware will have to perform data replication to different servers. 

A **detailed description** of the requirements can be found in chapter 2 of [this file](project_description.pdf).

The **final report** including a complete system description, the various experiments, a 2K analysis as well as the queueing model can be found [here](https://github.com/silvanegli/ASL17/blob/master/report.pdf).

An **outline** of the different files and folders is given [here](https://github.com/silvanegli/ASL17/blob/master/outline.txt).
