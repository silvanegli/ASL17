# Advanced Systems Lab
The project consisted of the design and development of a middleware platform for key-value stores (memcached)
as well as the evaluation and analysis of its performance. Also constructing an analytical model
and compare its predictions with the actual system behavior were part of the requirements.

A **detailed description** of the requirements can be found in chapter 2 of the [project description](project_description.pdf).

The **[final report](https://github.com/silvanegli/ASL17/blob/master/report.pdf)** includes a complete system description, the various experiments, a 2K analysis as well as the queueing model.

An **outline** of the different files and folders is given [here](https://github.com/silvanegli/ASL17/blob/master/outline.txt).
